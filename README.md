## + About the Project
SOS is a text-based game created using python. This is a command line application...

## + Main Objective
The game has been designed to promote the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 12 and 13: Responsible Consumption and Production and Climate Action. It aims to create awareness about the importance of waste management and how small steps in our everyday life can help in reducing pollution. It aims to teach the player the art of sorting waste so perfectly that sorting itself becomes second nature. 

### Objective 2
This project has been designed to showcase our understanding and proficiency in Python programming by demonstrating our knowledge of loops, data types, and functions. As we delve into the development of this project, we will explore various programming concepts that we have learned so far and apply them in the context of building a  game that is both entertaining and educational. To enhance the functionality of the game, we will be incorporating the use of databases. The program will store and retrieve data on high scores and their username, allowing the users to track their progress. As we work on this project, we will also place a strong emphasis on user-friendliness. The game will be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and a simple interface. 



## + Gameplay Scenario
You live in a post-apocaliptic where you have to ...

## + Modules Used
Make sure you have the following modules installed before running the game:
###### If you have Python3+ , you only have to install pandas

- pandas
- os 
- time
- random

If you don't have the modules: 
- Search for "Command Propmt" on your search bar
- Then type: 
- pandas: ```pip3 install pandas``` 
- random : ```pip install random``` 



## + Plans for the game
- More specific waste_types and more questions 
- Add settings: The user can control the intial amount of oxygen tank(time) and how much you lose or gain per answer. 
- If settings is implemented, a sorted highscore
- Add sound using playsound module
