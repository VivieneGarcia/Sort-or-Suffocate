## + About the Project
SOS is a command line application, a text-based game created in Python. It's a straightforward sorting game where your objective is to categorize trash based on its type (Biodegradable or Non-biodegradable) within a given time limit. The game keeps track of high scores and features a Wastebook filled with valuable information about waste management.

## + Main Objective
The game has been designed to promote the United Nations' **Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 12 and 13**: Responsible Consumption and Production and Climate Action. It aims to create awareness about the importance of waste management and how small steps in our everyday life can help in reducing pollution. It aims to teach the player the art of sorting waste so perfectly that sorting itself becomes second nature. 

### + Objective 2
This project has been designed to showcase our understanding and proficiency in Python programming by **demonstrating our knowledge of loops, data types, collections, functions, and classes**. As we delve into the development of this project, we will explore various programming concepts that we have learned so far and apply them in the context of building a  game that is both entertaining and educational. To enhance the game, we will be incorporating the use of **databases**. The program will store username and score and also retrieve it, allowing the users to track their progress. As we work on this project, we will also place a strong emphasis on **user-friendliness**. The game will be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions. 

## + Modules Used
Make sure you have the following modules installed before running the game:
###### If you have Python3+ , you only have to install pandas

- pandas
- os 
- time
- random

If you don't have the modules: 
- Search for "Command Propmt" on your search bar
- Then type: 
- pandas: ```pip3 install pandas``` 
- random : ```pip install random``` 

## + How to run the program
To run the program, follow these steps:
- Download the "main.py" file.
- Open an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code.
- Import the necessary modules or libraries required by the program.
- Run the program by executing the "main.py" file.
- Ensure that you have Python installed on your system and that the required dependencies are available in your environment.

## + Plans for the game
- Expansion of Waste Types and Question Types: Introduce a wider range of waste types to sort, such as recyclable, hazardous, or electronic waste. Additionally, incorporate different question types (ex. multiple choice, identification, odd one out, etc.)
- Add settings: The user can control the intial amount of oxygen tank(time) and how much you lose or gain per answer. 
- Sorted Highscores for each level
- Add sound using playsound module
